An open-source call simulation app to escape awkward situations or play pranks.

Surprisingly, finding a usable fake caller proved impossible. There are no apps on F-Droid, while 
apps on Google Play were visually outdated, didn't work when the screen was locked, or were simply ad farms. 
I decided to vibe code my own alternative: a modern, open-source app that will never track you or show ads.

Tested on Google Pixel 9 Pro XL. Contributions are welcome.
